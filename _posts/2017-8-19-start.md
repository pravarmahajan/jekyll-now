title: Finally, it's up!

After a lot of procrastination, I have finally been able to setup my own webpage. I would like to use this as a medium to blog about my projects, interests and thoughts.
I am interested in the area of Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. I am currently working on Text Analytics in Social Media, under the guidance of [Prof Wei Xu](https://cocoxu.github.io/).
